# AutoWay: Digital Navigation for Shared Taxis, Tempos & Autos

## Project Overview

**AutoWay** is a web application designed to help commuters navigate informal shared transport networks like taxis, tempos, and autos in Indian cities. The app provides step-by-step navigation, route planning, stand locations, and community-contributed updates to simplify multi-leg journeys and reduce dependency on local knowledge.

---

## Problem Statement

In many Indian cities, daily commuters rely on informal shared transport because it is cheaper and more accessible than app-based cabs. However:

- Routes are fixed but not documented digitally.
- Stands are often unmarked or difficult to locate.
- Multi-leg journeys require local knowledge, making them confusing.
- No digital platform exists to discover, navigate, or optimize these informal transport networks.

---

## Goal

Create a web app that:

- Maps informal shared transport networks.
- Guides commuters step-by-step.
- Enables community contributions for real-time updates.

---

## Target Users

- Students navigating city routes.
- Low-income commuters relying on affordable transport.
- Visitors or newcomers to the city.
- Urban planners analyzing informal transport patterns.

---

## Impact

- Empowers students and low-income commuters
- Reduces time wasted finding correct routes/stands
- Promotes shared transport for sustainability
- Provides data for urban planning and informal transport analysis
